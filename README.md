## *Passive Investing exchange-traded fund (ETF)* 

Objective - to script a financial database and web application using SQL, Python, and the VoilÃ  library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical FinTech ETF. 

Beyond the scope of the assignment, the author sought to conduct additional refinement and/or analysis of the data obtained and demonstrate further visualization....  Supplemental and/or extra analysis beyond the scope of the project is noted as 'supplemental' were approrpiate.

## **Methods**
### The code script analysis performed:
    
#### Step I - Analyze a single asset in the FinTech ETF, provide visualization

### **Dependencies**

This project leverages Jupyter Lab v3.4.4 and python v3.7 with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - Software library, NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, provides vast functionality.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

* [read_sql_query](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_sql_query.html) - From 'pandas', read SQL query into a DataFrame; returns a DataFrame corresponding to the result set of the SQL query string.

* [concat](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) - From 'pandas', concatenate pandas objects along a particular axis, allows optional set logic along the other axes.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - provides a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data into numerous formats listed within linked documentation.

* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

* [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html) - From 'SQLAlchemy', the starting point for any SQLAlchemy application; creates a tailored Dialect object, as well as a Pool object which will establish a DBAPI connection.

* [Inspection](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/inspection.html) - From 'SQLAlchemy', inspection module provides the inspect() function, which delivers runtime information about a wide variety of SQLAlchemy objects, both within the Core as well as the ORM.
