## *Proptech tool application - simulate one-click service to buy properties and then rent them*

Objective - to simulate local community PropTech consulting operations. 
Scenario - as acting analyst, within PropTech Firm (stakeholder/user), utilize data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to identify properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities. 
Product/deliverable - creation of a Jupyter notebook that contains your analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

Part 1:  import, clean, and analyze data

Part 2:  develop visualization tools to analyze the data

Beyond the scope of the assignment, the author sought to conduct additional refinement and/or analysis of the data obtained and demonstrate further visualization....  Supplemental and/or extra analysis beyond the scope of the project is noted as 'supplemental' were approrpiate.

### **Dependencies**

This project leverages Jupyter Lab v3.4.4 and python v3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - Software library written for the python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

* [read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) - From 'pandas', reads a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame.

* [concat](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) - From 'pandas', concatenate pandas objects along a particular axis, allows optional set logic along the other axes.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) - Software library, NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, provides vast functionality.

* [Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - From pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths, Path instantiates a concrete path for the platform the code is running on.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - provides a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data into numerous formats listed within linked documentation.
